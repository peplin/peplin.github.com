This is my [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). As a 90's
kid, I would be lost without a personal home page on the web. In this latest
incarnation, I've assumed the <strong>Threephase</strong> name (originally from a [grad school
project](/2011/05/threephase/)) to encompass a variety of my creative and professional
projects.

This site is also a useful playground for testing out the latest web tech.
Although I haven't done professional web development since 2015, it's still an
area of interest, particularly because it's so broadly accessible.
